# Zeller front-end coding challenge

# IMPORTANT - This project has 2 branches and I would encourage you to look at both main + the context-pattern branch as it demonstrates 2 different approaches to this solution

# Main:

Demonstrates the solution at the most basic level, where components are passed props

# Context-pattern branch:

This demonstrates a basic usage of the context-api pattern - although the app is not fully utilising it's strengths in it's current state, if the app was expanded, this gives the app more scalability and gives a better way to share state between components and avoid prop-drilling

TODO: would introduce a transformer layer which would transform the api response into a more friendly format

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
